# Autoencoders for galaxy observations

![](doc/vae-example.png)

Learning about galaxy images, and perhaps their latent representations, using autoencoders. Inspired by a [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/149Z8pDLj8w5GlLxqTtamcYfPLEaNHuAo?usp=sharing) during the *Machine Learning for Astrophysics and Astrophysics Problems for Machine Learning* NeurIPS 2020 tutorial led by [David W. Hogg](https://github.com/davidwhogg) and [Kate Storey-Fisher](https://github.com/kstoreyf).
